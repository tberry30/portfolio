      <h2>Waitr</h2><br>
      <p>Waitr was a collaboration created during group projects, while studying at DevMountain.  The concept was to create an app that patrons could use when deciding where to eat, by displaying current restaurant wait times, and allowing them to enter the waitlist directly on their mobile device from wherever they may be.
