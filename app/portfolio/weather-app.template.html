    <h2>WeatherView</h2><br>
    <p>This was the first Angular app that I built.  Focusing just on front-end development, WeatherView uses an API to grab the current weather conditions, based on the current location of the user, or for a location they request. Using Angular directives, I was able to do a side by side comparison for multiple locations.</p>
