    <h2>Wasatch Sports</h2><br>
    <p>Wasatch Sports is an app based on the need to bring a local ski rental facility into the modern web world.  Many small businesses still function with pen and paper.  When data for say, your customers is needed, it meant pulling open a file cabinet and manually going through forms.  This site is an example of bringing the entire rental process to the web, from reservation to fulfullment.  The data can be accessed much more easily, empowering a small business to reach new heights.</p>
