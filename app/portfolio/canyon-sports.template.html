    <h3>Canyon Sports</h3><br>
    <p>While working at a local ski shop, I helped to update an old site, rewriting the code form ASP.NET to PHP.  Working with a designer, we updated all pages, created new navigation, and added new pages including a ski and weather report using a datafeed from SkiUtah.com.</p>
